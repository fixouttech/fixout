## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report security vulnerabilities by opening a new [GitHub security
advisory](https://github.com/fixouttech/fixout/security/advisories/new).

Or you can send an email to `fixout.ext@gmail.com`.

<!--
If the security vulnerability is accepted, a patch will be crafted privately
in order to prepare a dedicated bugfix release as timely as possible (depending
on the complexity of the fix).
 
In addition to the options above, you can also report security vulnerabilities
to [tidelift](https://tidelift.com/security).
